This is very simple dashboard for tracking outstanding bugs in Ironic.

It is an AIOHTTP application and can be run as such. For local testing use:

    $ tox -erun

For actual production, a Dockerfile is provided that uses gunicorn internally:

    $ podman build -t ironic-bug-dashboard .
    $ podman run --name ironic-bug-dashboard --publish 8000:8000 ironic-bug-dashboard
