This is very simple dashboard for tracking outstanding bugs in Ironic.

It is a Flask application and can be run as such. For local testing use:

    $ tox -erun

For actual production you may want something like gunicorn:

    $ gunicorn --workers 2 ironic_bug_dashboard:app

A Dockerfile is also provided:

    $ podman build -t ironic-bug-dashboard .
    $ podman run --name ironic-bug-dashboard --publish 8000:8000 ironic-bug-dashboard
