This is a dashboard for tracking outstanding bugs in **Ironic**.

**Ironic** is one of the software components in OpenStack that fully manages baremetal infrastructure; it discovers bare-metal modes; catalogs them in a management database and manages the entire server lifecycle; from enrolling to provisioning, maintenance and decomissioning.

And **OpenStack** is an opensource cloud software project that is made up of a collection of software components that provide common services for cloud infrastructure.

## Setup
Before diving into the setup process, ensure that your Python version is `>=python3.11`.

### Creating a Virtual Environment
To keep your dependencies isolated, it's recommended to create a virtual environment. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
$ env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

This will activate the virtual environment, providing a clean workspace for your project.

### Installing Dependencies
Once inside your virtual environment, you can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage
This is an AIOHTTP application and can be run as such.


### üß™ Run in Development

```
$ tox -erun
```

### üöÄ Run in Production
